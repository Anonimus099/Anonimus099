### A bit about me
Hey! I'm TheArchitect, welcome to my GitHub page. I love open source and am always striving to improve my coding skills. I share that enthusiasm with everyone through my social media and hopefully act as a resource for anyone starting the journey.

### What I'm hacking on
I'm keeping my personal projects private at the moment since my progress on them is slow going. I'll definitely share them when I have more to show. For now they're just for my own learning and enjoyment.

### Nerd Corner
* Keyboards: Alligator GK-315 (main keyboard)
* Editor: Vs code, Cursor, LazyVim
